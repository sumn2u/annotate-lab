# Annotate-Lab

Annotate-Lab is an open-source application designed for image annotation, comprising two main components: the client and the server. The client, a React application, is responsible for the user interface where users perform annotations. On the other hand, the server, a Flask application, manages persisting the annotated changes and generating masked and annotated images, along with configuration settings. More information can be found in our [documentation](./docs/annotate-lab.md).

### Client
- **public/**: Static files and the root HTML file.
- **src/**: React components and other frontend code.
- **package.json**: Contains client dependencies and scripts.

### Server
- **db/**: Database-related files and handlers.
- **venv/**: Python virtual environment (not included in version control).
- **tests/**: Contains test files.
- **app.py**: Main Flask application file.
- **requirements.txt**: Contains server dependencies.

## Settings
One can configure the tools, tags, upload images and do many more from the settings.

## Dependencies

### Client
- React
- Axios
- Other dependencies as listed in `package.json`

### Server
- Flask
- Flask-CORS
- pandas
- Other dependencies as listed in `requirements.txt`

## Setup and Installation

### Client Setup
1. Navigate to the `client` directory:
   ```sh
   cd client
    ```
2. Install the dependencies:
    ```sh
   npm install
    ```
### Server Setup
1. Navigate to the `server` directory:
   ```sh
   cd server
    ```
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```sh
   python3 -m venv venv

    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
3. Install the dependencies:
```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Application

### Running the Client
1. Navigate to the `client` directory:
   ```sh
   cd client
    ```
2. Install the dependencies:
    ```sh
   npm start
   ```
The application should now be running on [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).


### Running the Server
1. Navigate to the `server` directory:
   ```sh
   cd server
    ```
2. Activate the virtual environment:
    ```sh
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
3. Start the Flask application:
   ```sh
   flask run
    ```
The server should now be running on [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

### Running using Docker.
First, change the `VITE_SERVER_URL` to  `http://127.0.0.1:8080`.
Then, navigate to the root directory and run the following command to start the application: 
```sh
docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d #running in detached mode

```

## Usage

1. Open your web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).
2. Use the user interface to upload and annotate images.
3. The annotations and other interactions will be handled by the Flask server running at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

## Outputs
Sample of annotated image  along with its mask and settings is show below.

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure that both the client and server are running.
- Check the browser console and terminal for any errors and troubleshoot accordingly.
- Verify that dependencies are correctly installed.
